   abstract = {Our study harnesses the power of NLP to contribute to the identification of suicidal ideation in text data. In the realm of mental health, identification of suicidal ideation at an early stage is of paramount importance for suicide prevention efforts. This paper presents a novel approach to suicide ideation detection using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Faced with a dearth of publicly available datasets for this critical task, we have contributed a valuable resource by curating a dataset from the 'SuicideWatch' and 'depression' subreddits on the Reddit platform, collected via the Pushshift API. Specifically, we employ the LSTM and a Random Forest classifier separately to achieve promising results in this vital area of research. This work not only advances the field of NLP-based suicide ideation detection but also contributes a valuable dataset for future investigations, potentially saving time and resources for researchers and professionals dedicated to the prevention of suicide and the improvement of mental health. We could achieve up to 93% accuracy in suicidal thought analysis using NLP techniques.},

   abstract = {A distribution transformer fault refers to a malfunction or abnormal condition that occurs in a distribution transformer, which is a vital component in electrical power distribution systems. Distribution transformers lower high transmission voltage for use in homes and businesses. In this study, we address the critical challenge of transformer fault detection by employing a comprehensive approach that harnesses the power of advanced machine-learning techniques. We conducted extensive experiments utilizing a diverse dataset to predict and classify four distinct types of transformer faults. Leveraging the capabilities of twelve different classification algorithms, such as - SVM, DecisionTree(DT), AdaBoost, RandomForest(RF), ExtraTrees(ET), GradientBoosting(GB), MultipleLayerPerceptron(MLP), KNeighbors, LogisticRegression(LR), LinearDiscriminantAnalysis, XGBoost, and LGBM, we implemented a robust methodology that outperformed prior results, achieving a significantly higher accuracy rate. Key to our success is the integration of cross-validation, ensuring the reliability and generalization of our predictive models. This research advances the field of transformer fault prediction, offering a more accurate and dependable framework for identifying and mitigating critical issues in power distribution systems. The results hold substantial promise for enhancing the reliability and safety of transformer operations, with far-reaching implications for the energy industry.},

   abstract = {Unforeseen failures in the electrical power transmission line may arise due to various unpredictable factors. The occurrence of power failures on transmission lines has the potential to cause significant damage to the existing power grid unless prompt detection and correction of faults are carried out. The primary objective of this paper is to address the detection and classification of faults occurring on electrical power transmission lines. Specifically, the study focuses on a dataset consisting of 12,000 data points, each characterized by six distinct features. To achieve this, artificial neural networks are employed as the chosen methodology. The classification of transmission line faults was performed using various machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Bagging Classifier, and XGBoost. The algorithms were evaluated based on parameters including accuracy, error rate, prediction speed, and training time. The findings suggest that tree-based classifiers have exhibited superior performance, achieving 100% accuracy in the classification of transmission line faults. On the other hand, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM) have yielded average results in this regard.},

  abstract = {Lung cancer is characterized by high mortality and incidence rates, making it one of the most prevalent cancers globally. Early detection significantly improves the chances of survival for individuals affected by this disease. The histopathological diagnosis is a crucial factor in determining the specific type of cancer. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in novel computer-aided diagnostic techniques utilizing deep learning algorithms for the early detection of lung cancer. However, sharing sensitive patient data is significantly restricted by regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR, primarily due to privacy concerns. Given the current constraints, institutions face challenges in effectively exchanging information to enhance the accuracy of lung cancer classification. In order to address the issue of privacy in lung cancer classification, we propose a federated learning approach. This methodology involves employing local models with an Inception-v3 backbone to carry out the classification of histopathological images of lung cancer & updating the global model based on the local weights. These images have been obtained from the LC25000 dataset. The lung cancer images from the LC25000 dataset were analyzed, which consisted of three distinct classes. Each class contained a total of 5000 images. The applied model has achieved a classification accuracy of 99.867% in categorizing lung cancer images into three distinct classes. The performance of the proposed framework has demonstrated superiority over other existing methodologies. Furthermore, this solution effectively addresses the privacy concerns associated with the sharing of medical data among different institutions.},

   abstract = {Brain tumors have become a severe medical complication in recent years due to their high fatality rate. Radiologists segment the tumor manually, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and expensive. In recent years, automated segmentation based on deep learning has demonstrated promising results in solving computer vision problems such as image classification and segmentation. Brain tumor segmentation has recently become a prevalent task in medical imaging to determine the tumor location, size, and shape using automated methods. Many researchers have worked on various machine and deep learning approaches to determine the most optimal solution using the convolutional methodology. In this review paper, we discuss the most effective segmentation techniques based on the datasets that are widely used and publicly available. We also proposed a survey of federated learning methodologies to enhance global segmentation performance and ensure privacy. A comprehensive literature review is suggested after studying more than 100 papers to generalize the most recent techniques in segmentation and multi-modality information. Finally, we concentrated on unsolved problems in brain tumor segmentation and a client-based federated model training strategy. Based on this review, future researchers will understand the optimal solution path to solve these issues.},
