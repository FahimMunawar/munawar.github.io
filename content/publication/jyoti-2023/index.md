abstract: A distribution transformer fault refers to a malfunction or abnormal condition
  that occurs in a distribution transformer, which is a vital component in electrical
  power distribution systems. Distribution transformers lower high transmission voltage
  for use in homes and businesses. In this study, we address the critical challenge
  of transformer fault detection by employing a comprehensive approach that harnesses
  the power of advanced machine-learning techniques. We conducted extensive experiments
  utilizing a diverse dataset to predict and classify four distinct types of transformer
  faults. Leveraging the capabilities of twelve different classification algorithms,
  such as - SVM, DecisionTree(DT), AdaBoost, RandomForest(RF), ExtraTrees(ET), GradientBoosting(GB),
  MultipleLayerPerceptron(MLP), KNeighbors, LogisticRegression(LR), LinearDiscriminantAnalysis,
  XGBoost, and LGBM, we implemented a robust methodology that outperformed prior results,
  achieving a significantly higher accuracy rate. Key to our success is the integration
  of cross-validation, ensuring the reliability and generalization of our predictive
  models. This research advances the field of transformer fault prediction, offering
  a more accurate and dependable framework for identifying and mitigating critical
  issues in power distribution systems. The results hold substantial promise for enhancing
  the reliability and safety of transformer operations, with far-reaching implications
  for the energy industry.
