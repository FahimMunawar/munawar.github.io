abstract: Lung cancer is characterized by high mortality and incidence rates, making
  it one of the most prevalent cancers globally. Early detection significantly improves
  the chances of survival for individuals affected by this disease. The histopathological
  diagnosis is a crucial factor in determining the specific type of cancer. In recent
  years, there has been a significant increase in novel computer-aided diagnostic
  techniques utilizing deep learning algorithms for the early detection of lung cancer.
  However, sharing sensitive patient data is significantly restricted by regulations
  such as HIPAA and GDPR, primarily due to privacy concerns. Given the current constraints,
  institutions face challenges in effectively exchanging information to enhance the
  accuracy of lung cancer classification. In order to address the issue of privacy
  in lung cancer classification, we propose a federated learning approach. This methodology
  involves employing local models with an Inception-v3 backbone to carry out the classification
  of histopathological images of lung cancer & updating the global model based on
  the local weights. These images have been obtained from the LC25000 dataset. The
  lung cancer images from the LC25000 dataset were analyzed, which consisted of three
  distinct classes. Each class contained a total of 5000 images. The applied model
  has achieved a classification accuracy of 99.867% in categorizing lung cancer images
  into three distinct classes. The performance of the proposed framework has demonstrated
  superiority over other existing methodologies. Furthermore, this solution effectively
  addresses the privacy concerns associated with the sharing of medical data among
  different institutions.

abstract: A distribution transformer fault refers to a malfunction or abnormal condition
  that occurs in a distribution transformer, which is a vital component in electrical
  power distribution systems. Distribution transformers lower high transmission voltage
  for use in homes and businesses. In this study, we address the critical challenge
  of transformer fault detection by employing a comprehensive approach that harnesses
  the power of advanced machine-learning techniques. We conducted extensive experiments
  utilizing a diverse dataset to predict and classify four distinct types of transformer
  faults. Leveraging the capabilities of twelve different classification algorithms,
  such as - SVM, DecisionTree(DT), AdaBoost, RandomForest(RF), ExtraTrees(ET), GradientBoosting(GB),
  MultipleLayerPerceptron(MLP), KNeighbors, LogisticRegression(LR), LinearDiscriminantAnalysis,
  XGBoost, and LGBM, we implemented a robust methodology that outperformed prior results,
  achieving a significantly higher accuracy rate. Key to our success is the integration
  of cross-validation, ensuring the reliability and generalization of our predictive
  models. This research advances the field of transformer fault prediction, offering
  a more accurate and dependable framework for identifying and mitigating critical
  issues in power distribution systems. The results hold substantial promise for enhancing
  the reliability and safety of transformer operations, with far-reaching implications
  for the energy industry.

abstract: Unforeseen failures in the electrical power transmission line may arise
  due to various unpredictable factors. The occurrence of power failures on transmission
  lines has the potential to cause significant damage to the existing power grid unless
  prompt detection and correction of faults are carried out. The primary objective
  of this paper is to address the detection and classification of faults occurring
  on electrical power transmission lines. Specifically, the study focuses on a dataset
  consisting of 12,000 data points, each characterized by six distinct features. To
  achieve this, artificial neural networks are employed as the chosen methodology.
  The classification of transmission line faults was performed using various machine
  learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM),
  Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Bagging Classifier, and XGBoost. The algorithms
  were evaluated based on parameters including accuracy, error rate, prediction speed,
  and training time. The findings suggest that tree-based classifiers have exhibited
  superior performance, achieving 100% accuracy in the classification of transmission
  line faults. On the other hand, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines
  (SVM) have yielded average results in this regard.

abstract: Our study harnesses the power of NLP to contribute to the identification
  of suicidal ideation in text data. In the realm of mental health, identification
  of suicidal ideation at an early stage is of paramount importance for suicide prevention
  efforts. This paper presents a novel approach to suicide ideation detection using
  Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Faced with a dearth of publicly available
  datasets for this critical task, we have contributed a valuable resource by curating
  a dataset from the 'SuicideWatch' and 'depression' subreddits on the Reddit platform,
  collected via the Pushshift API. Specifically, we employ the LSTM and a Random Forest
  classifier separately to achieve promising results in this vital area of research.
  This work not only advances the field of NLP-based suicide ideation detection but
  also contributes a valuable dataset for future investigations, potentially saving
  time and resources for researchers and professionals dedicated to the prevention
  of suicide and the improvement of mental health. We could achieve up to 93% accuracy
  in suicidal thought analysis using NLP techniques.
