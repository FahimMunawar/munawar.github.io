abstract: Our study harnesses the power of NLP to contribute to the identification
  of suicidal ideation in text data. In the realm of mental health, identification
  of suicidal ideation at an early stage is of paramount importance for suicide prevention
  efforts. This paper presents a novel approach to suicide ideation detection using
  Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Faced with a dearth of publicly available
  datasets for this critical task, we have contributed a valuable resource by curating
  a dataset from the 'SuicideWatch' and 'depression' subreddits on the Reddit platform,
  collected via the Pushshift API. Specifically, we employ the LSTM and a Random Forest
  classifier separately to achieve promising results in this vital area of research.
  This work not only advances the field of NLP-based suicide ideation detection but
  also contributes a valuable dataset for future investigations, potentially saving
  time and resources for researchers and professionals dedicated to the prevention
  of suicide and the improvement of mental health. We could achieve up to 93% accuracy
  in suicidal thought analysis using NLP techniques.
