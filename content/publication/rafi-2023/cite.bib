 abstract = {Our study harnesses the power of NLP to contribute to the identification of suicidal ideation in text data. In the realm of mental health, identification of suicidal ideation at an early stage is of paramount importance for suicide prevention efforts. This paper presents a novel approach to suicide ideation detection using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Faced with a dearth of publicly available datasets for this critical task, we have contributed a valuable resource by curating a dataset from the 'SuicideWatch' and 'depression' subreddits on the Reddit platform, collected via the Pushshift API. Specifically, we employ the LSTM and a Random Forest classifier separately to achieve promising results in this vital area of research. This work not only advances the field of NLP-based suicide ideation detection but also contributes a valuable dataset for future investigations, potentially saving time and resources for researchers and professionals dedicated to the prevention of suicide and the improvement of mental health. We could achieve up to 93% accuracy in suicidal thought analysis using NLP techniques.},
