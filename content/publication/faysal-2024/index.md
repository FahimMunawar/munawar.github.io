abstract: "To properly diagnose and screen for skin disorders, precise segmentation
  of the affected area is required. Segmenting skin lesions is difficult because of
  factors such as the form of the lesion, its proximity to surrounding skin, and the
  presence of hair. To effectively tackle this matter, we present a pioneering technique
  that utilizes deep learning to achieve comprehensive automation in skin lesion segmentation.
  This approach incorporates advanced preprocessing methodologies to enhance the overall
  performance. The architecture Attention-UNet is employed for the purpose of selectively
  segmenting images of skin lesions. The high detection rate of this design allows
  for precise melanoma segmentation in real-time. Finally, in the post-processing
  phase, we applied test-time augmentation (TTA) to further enhance segmentation precision.
  Both the ISIC 2017 and ISIC 2018 skin lesion datasets were used for training and
  testing the suggested technique. The model's mDSC, mIoU, recall, and precision were
  all 91.93%, 88.15%, 92.72%, and 91.15%, respectively, when trained independently
  on the ISIC 2017 datasets. Separate training on the ISIC 2018 datasets achieved
  similar results: 92.17% mDSC, 90.26% mIoU, 92.34% recall, and 92.01% precision.
  After being trained on a dataset consisting ISIC data from both 2017 and 2018, the
  proposed method achieved mDSC scores of 92.30% percent, mIoU scores of 90.06% percent,
  recall rates of 93.91% percent, and precision rates of 90.74% percent. Our model
  demonstrates superior FPS scores compared to other models, indicating effective
  real-time performance. Due to its scalability and reliability, the suggested methodological
  framework may be utilized to create a completely automated computer-aided skin lesion
  diagnostic system."
