abstract: Brain tumors have become a severe medical complication in recent years due
  to their high fatality rate. Radiologists segment the tumor manually, which is time-consuming,
  error-prone, and expensive. In recent years, automated segmentation based on deep
  learning has demonstrated promising results in solving computer vision problems
  such as image classification and segmentation. Brain tumor segmentation has recently
  become a prevalent task in medical imaging to determine the tumor location, size,
  and shape using automated methods. Many researchers have worked on various machine
  and deep learning approaches to determine the most optimal solution using the convolutional
  methodology. In this review paper, we discuss the most effective segmentation techniques
  based on the datasets that are widely used and publicly available. We also proposed
  a survey of federated learning methodologies to enhance global segmentation performance
  and ensure privacy. A comprehensive literature review is suggested after studying
  more than 100 papers to generalize the most recent techniques in segmentation and
  multi-modality information. Finally, we concentrated on unsolved problems in brain
  tumor segmentation and a client-based federated model training strategy. Based on
  this review, future researchers will understand the optimal solution path to solve
  these issues.
