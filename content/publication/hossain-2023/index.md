abstract: Lung cancer is characterized by high mortality and incidence rates, making
  it one of the most prevalent cancers globally. Early detection significantly improves
  the chances of survival for individuals affected by this disease. The histopathological
  diagnosis is a crucial factor in determining the specific type of cancer. In recent
  years, there has been a significant increase in novel computer-aided diagnostic
  techniques utilizing deep learning algorithms for the early detection of lung cancer.
  However, sharing sensitive patient data is significantly restricted by regulations
  such as HIPAA and GDPR, primarily due to privacy concerns. Given the current constraints,
  institutions face challenges in effectively exchanging information to enhance the
  accuracy of lung cancer classification. In order to address the issue of privacy
  in lung cancer classification, we propose a federated learning approach. This methodology
  involves employing local models with an Inception-v3 backbone to carry out the classification
  of histopathological images of lung cancer & updating the global model based on
  the local weights. These images have been obtained from the LC25000 dataset. The
  lung cancer images from the LC25000 dataset were analyzed, which consisted of three
  distinct classes. Each class contained a total of 5000 images. The applied model
  has achieved a classification accuracy of 99.867% in categorizing lung cancer images
  into three distinct classes. The performance of the proposed framework has demonstrated
  superiority over other existing methodologies. Furthermore, this solution effectively
  addresses the privacy concerns associated with the sharing of medical data among
  different institutions.
